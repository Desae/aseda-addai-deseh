2. **End-to-End Agent Behavior**: Complete workflow from user query to personalized program recommendations

3. **Agentic Steps Highlighted**:
   - 🧠 **Planning**: AI breaks down queries into search strategies
   - 🔧 **Tool Calls**: Web searches via Serper API
   - 💾 **Memory Use**: Profile persistence across conversation turns

## ⏱️ Timestamps & Script

### **00:00–00:30 — Introduction & Setup**


**Script:**
> "Hi, I'm demonstrating GradPath, an agentic AI assistant for graduate school search. 
> Unlike traditional search, GradPath understands your complete profile, remembers your preferences, 
> and conducts intelligent multi-query searches to find the best programs for you."


---

### **00:30–01:30 — User Input → Planning Step**


**Script:**
> "Watch what happens when I enter my query. The Coordinator agent first extracts my profile: 
> GPA of 3.4, field is Data Science, degree level is Master's, preferred countries are US and Canada, 
> and I need full funding without GRE requirement."
>
> "The Planner agent then creates an optimized search strategy with multiple queries targeting 
> different aspects - program pages, funding info, and admission requirements."



---

### **01:30–02:30 — Tool Calls & Memory Retrieval**

**Script for Serper API:**
> "Now the Search Executor performs multiple web searches using the Serper API. 
> Each query targets different universities and program aspects. 
> Watch as it searches for 'MS Data Science fully funded USA', then 'Data Science graduate programs Canada no GRE', 
> and synthesizes results from multiple sources."



**Script for Memory:**
> "Here's the key agentic feature - memory. When I ask about Germany, 
> notice it doesn't ask for my GPA or field again. It remembers everything from our conversation 
> and just adds Germany to my preferences."



---

### **02:30–03:30 — Final Output & Edge-Case Handling**


**Script:**
> "The Writer agent synthesizes everything into a formatted response. 
> Notice the table with program names, universities, funding info, and direct links. 
> Below that, personalized guidance explains why each program fits my profile."
>
> "The agent also suggests follow-up questions. Let me click one to dive deeper into Stanford's program."


---

### **03:30–04:00 — Wrap-up (Optional)**


**Script:**
> "Finally, GradPath supports multiple chat sessions like ChatGPT. 
> I can start a new chat for a different search, and return to this one anytime with all context preserved."
>
> "To summarize: GradPath demonstrates true agentic AI with intelligent planning, 
> dynamic tool use, persistent memory, and adaptive conversation handling. 
> It transforms the overwhelming grad school search into a guided, personalized experience."
